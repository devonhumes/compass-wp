= compass-wp

This is a plugin that allows the creation of SASS/Compass compatible WordPress template files.
Currently there is just one bare-bones template but it should suffice for now.  More base templates will follow
as I get feedback as to what users want to see.  Please feel free to use this for whatever WordPress project you
have a need for.

== Installation/Use

This plugin requires that compass be installed before it will run.

To make the stylesheets compile correctly please change the default css_dir setting in the config.rb.
* Change css_dir = "stylesheets" to css_dir = "." 
* I am researching better ways to do this but this will work for now.

== Contributing to compass-wp
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
